    "This tutorial is about implementing reinfocement learning using the reinforcement learning package in the pybrain library. We beleive that you have already installed the required libraries: scipy, numpy, matplotlib, and pylab. \n",

    "First we will go through a reinforcement learning example already provided in pybrain. This is a very popular MDP example. We have setup a jupyter notebook that walks you through the maze example. \n",

    "Try the Maze example. Next we are going to apply reinforcement learning to a HCI problem -- Menu search. We will edit the enviroment, reward, and actions of the maze example to implement the menu search in two scenarios: \n",
